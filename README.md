# Imputation-of-missing-IPC-codes-and-technology-information-for-worldwide-patent-data

The code entails a general method for imputing missing information in IPC codes and a broader technology classification in the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT).
The algorithm can be easily adapted to impute other pieces of information that are missing in PATSTAT.
The algorithm runs with any PATSTAT version newer than Autumn 2016, with only minor adaptations. 
However, careful inspection of the PATSTAT data catalog of the respective PATSTAT version is warranted to adjust to changing data schema (minor changes such as relabeling of columns can happen over time).
